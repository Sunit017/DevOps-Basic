Docker ========================
-------------------------------

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight
, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that the application runs consistently across 
different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Key Features of Docker:==========================
------------------------------------------------

Containerization:------
Docker containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, including libraries and configurations, in a single, isolated unit that can run anywhere.

Portability:---
Containers can run on any machine that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system, making it easier to move applications
between environments.

Efficiency:---
Containers share the host system's kernel and resources, making them more lightweight and faster to start compared to traditional virtual machines.

Scalability:--
Docker makes it simple to scale applications up or down by creating or destroying containers as needed, often orchestrated using tools like Kubernetes
or Docker Swarm.

Version Control:---
Docker images can be versioned, allowing developers to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

Isolation:--
Each container runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that processes inside the container do not interfere with other containers or the host system.

Common Docker Components:------------
=====================================================

Docker Engine:--------
 The core component that enables the creation and management of Docker containers.
Dockerfile:------
A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.
Docker Image:---------
 A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
Docker Container:--------
 A running instance of a Docker image, encapsulating an application and its environment.
Docker Hub:-------
 A cloud-based repository where Docker users can store and share Docker images.
