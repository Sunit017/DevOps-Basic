What is Apache Kafka ?
Ans - Apache Kafka an opensource distributed event streaming platform 

EventStreaming - Creating real time streaming and process real time streaming  


Why Apache Kafka ?

1.High Throughput (read write operation )
2.Fault Tolerance (Handle failures without completely collapsing)
3.Durable
4.Scalable 


 ---------------Architecture -----------------------
 
 Zookeeper -----  helps kafka broker state managemnet / track the kafka cluster / manager for broker 
 
 Producer -- It is the Source of data which produces message or event 
 Consumer -- Act as receiver which receive message or event
 Kafka Server/Broker - Intermediate between producer and consumer 
 
 Cluster --- mean in noramlly word distributed system / group of systems/computer working for same porpose , kafka is a distributed system it has multiple server and
 broker inside a single kafka cluster 
 
 Broker- Kafka server (multi server))
 
 Topic - comes under broker to categories data  Ex - Paytm - paytm application have differnt features payment , recharge ,booking and here paytm is producer
 and consumer asked broker give me all payment related messages and broker asked which kind of payment related things you want so that case consumer will hurt 	
 whats why topic came to market to catagories things like payment topic , booking topic , recharge topic 
 
 Partition - comes under topic  store data (with help of offset ) /it will come sit anywhere in round robbin principle 
 offset - as soon as message comes to partition a number is assign into it that is called offset 
 
 Consumer Group -- as name suggest it is group of consumers, multiple consumers combined to share the workload . it is like dividing large task into small small pieces 
 
 
 zookeeper Start ==> bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties
 
 Kafka Server Start ==>bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties

Kafka use ZooKeeper 

for create new topic == kafka topic

produce example message with kafka-console-producer

consume the message with kafka-console consumer

create new kafka topic ==>bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic user-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


producer create ==> bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --topic user-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


consumer => bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic user-topic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092



NewTopic(class) helps to create topic ==>return TopicBuilder.name("location-update").pratition
.build()


by the help of producer , we can produce message ==> by help KafkaTemplate<key,value>
send() inside it so kafkatemplate.send(topic,message)

Producer configuration
spring.kafka.producer.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
